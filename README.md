# Contributing

In order to contribute to THI, you must make all of your edits on your own development branch. To do so, create a new branch from your command line:

`git checkout -b my-new-branch`
From here, all your changes should be pushed to this branch, and not master.

When you are done working on your feature, submit a pull request through GitHub, which must be approved by a Team Lead before it is merged with master.

Best Coding Practices
We want to keep our code as clean as possible, so it's important to follow these best development practices before submitting your PR!

- Don't leave commented-out code in your files.
- Make sure there are no warnings when React compiles after running npm start
- Make sure there are no warnings in the JavaScript development console
- Add comments to your files describing what each function does
- When creating a PR, make sure you describe what the PR does, and how a Team Lead should review and test it!
